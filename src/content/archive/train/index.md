### The Project

Train Scheduler was the final project for the Rutgers Fall 2020 class Principles of Information and Data Management (CS336). It is a full-stack train booking web app that stores train routes and user data via efficient database schema. Users can search train routes stored in an AWS RDS database, create an account to create, modify, and delete reservations, and browse available schedules. The app also supports admin and employee configuration â€“ employees can answer customer questions in a forum, and admins to view sales reports and customer employee information. It is hosted on an AWS EC2 instance through Apache Tomcat and leverages SQL and Java Servlet Pages to provide functionality to the user.

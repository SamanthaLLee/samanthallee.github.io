The <a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/CSLLC/Douglass-SAS-DIMACS"> Computer Science Living-Learning Community</a> (CS LLC) is an opportunity available to first-year undergraduate women at Rutgers who have indicated a strong interest in majoring in Computer Science. Participating students enjoy the benefits of sharing common residential and academic experiences while making new friends, exploring common interests, and being part of a close community of peers.

I am a member of Cohort 3 of the CSLLC and active in various of its initiatives â€“ I am a peer mentor, am currently helping develop the official website, and am constantly working to improve and enrich our community.

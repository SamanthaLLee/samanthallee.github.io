### The Project
VG Sports is a full-stack web app that promotes physical activity and social engagement by streamlining the event-planning process of planning intramural sport games. It utilizes Angular.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Node.js to store user data and support various features like team creation, tournament scheduling, team and sport browsing.

I personally worked on account and team creation and built the forms that updated the MongoDB database.

### Abstract

People have always consumed media in selective and partisan ways. As social media become dominant forms of news and entertainment, users introduce personal biases to the platforms they use, and platforms respond by amplifying those biases. Recommendation systems established for commercial gain aim to increase engagement and consequently create feedback loops of bias through individual and collaborative personalization that affects digital communities on both local and global scales. Literature reveals that social media algorithms create filter bubbles, homogenize groups, and prioritize popular opinions over minority ones, thereby increasing the strengths of pre-existing beliefs, polarization, ingroup loyalty, and misrepresentation. A related, albeit weaker, consequence of social media influence manifests in the backlash effect, in which fact-checkers have counterproductive consequences and have further impacts on civic engagement. Despite dire implications, researchers demonstrate that various factors can mitigate the effect of bias and, and they work toward developing systems geared toward fairness and diversity to alleviate sociopolitical strife.

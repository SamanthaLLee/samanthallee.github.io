I am a teaching assistant for Data Structures (<a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-112-data-structures">01:198:112</a>), a required CS course taught in Java. I lead weekly recitations and study groups, evaluate projects, and grade exams for a section of ~45 students. The class covers a variety of topics, including hash tables, trees, graphs, sorting, and space-time complexity.

To complement my work, I am taking a pedagogy course to facilitate learning and engage students in scientific discourse.

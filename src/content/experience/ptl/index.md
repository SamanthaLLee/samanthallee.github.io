I am a teaching assistant for Data Structures (<a href="https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/academics/undergraduate/course-synopses/course-details/01-198-112-data-structures">01:198:112</a>), a required CS course taught in Java. The class covers a variety of topics, including hash tables, trees, graphs, sorting, and space-time complexity.

In Fall 2020, I led weekly recitations and study groups, evaluated projects, and graded exams for a section of ~45 students. 

Currently, I lead weekly recitations for three sections ranging from 6 to 13 students and curate lesson slides for the 20 other teaching assistants. To complement my work, I am taking a pedagogy course to facilitate learning and engage students in scientific discourse.

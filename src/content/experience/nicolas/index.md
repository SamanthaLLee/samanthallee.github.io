### Overview

During my time in the <a href="https://www.nicolaslab.org/">Nicolas Lab</a>, I had the pleasure to work on two projects: 

1. A literature review of the bias in recommendation systems and its subsequent social implications. 
2. A proposal for a research study designed to examine Asian American identities online and the perception of other ethnic groups (with a focus on BLM).

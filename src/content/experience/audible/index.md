### Background

This is the <a href="https://www.audible.com/">Audible</a> buybox. On all platforms and devices, it presents purchase options available to the user.

<p><div style="text-align:center"><img alt="A picture of the product detail page of an Audible audiobook. A red arrow points to the buybox, a section to the left of the screen that lists all options available to the user: 'Buy for $0.00', 'Add to Cart','Add to Wish List', etc." src="../../../../images/buybox.png" width="80%"/></div></p>

### My Work

I upgraded the special promotion section of the Audible buy box in Java to minimize code redundancy, centralize logic, mitigate error boundaries, and improve consistency across buy boxes. I designed a BOGO API while following existing architectural standards to integrate section into website framework.

### Reflection

A huge thank you to Xinyu Zhang, Mayank Gupta, Doug Haber, and the Rubiks team for for their support and guidance throughout the summer!

### Background

<div style="text-align:center"><img alt="A poster presenting Sam's work through two flowcharts. The first one shows how the full data load work consists of fetching seven years' worth of brokerage data and how the change data capture work involves setting up lambdas to live capture incoming employer contributions and new accounts of mandatory types. Both units of work end with the flagging of ERISA-mandatory and ERISA-eligible accounts, the data being pushed to DynamoDB, and the data being written to an S3 gold copy bucket. The second flowchart shows the algorithm through the tech that is used via this sequence: DB2 points to Attunity points to Amazon Kinesis points to and Amazon Lambda points to both Amazon DynamoDB and Amazon S3" src="../../../../docs/buybox.png" width="100%"/></div>

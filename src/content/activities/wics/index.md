<a href="https://rutgerswics.org/">Rutgers Women in Computer Science</a> is a student organization dedicated to the advancement of women in CS. We aim to build a supportive community, promote educational and professional development, and empower our members to overcome societal barriers.

From April 2019 to April 2020, I was the Graphics Chair of WiCS. In this position, I exercised my design skills to fortify our brand image, attract company sponsors, and market our events to thousands. Currently, I am the Hackathon Director and Co-President of WiCS and am organizing our annual women-centric hackathon, <a href="https://rutgerswics.org/">HackHERS</a>.

The <a href="https://sashonors.rutgers.edu/opportunities/engagement-leadership/tutoring-project"> SASHP Tutoring Project</a> is a free resource offered by the Learning Centers and School of Arts and Sciences Honors Program that provides one-on-one tutoring to all undergraduate students.

I've tutored for Introduction to Computer Science (CS111) and Data Structures (CS112) since Fall 2019.

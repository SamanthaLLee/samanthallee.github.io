The <a href="https://usacs.rutgers.edu/">Undergraduate Student Alliance of Computer Scientists</a> is Rutgers University's largest CS club. We provide students with educational resources and curriculums outside of coursework and encourage the skill acquisition, career development, and innovation</h3>

I am the Research Pipeline Director and am developing a program that connects driven undergraduates interested in research with professors seeking assistants. Additionally, I am planning a research fair at which representatives from Rutgers research groups can present their work and generate interest amongst club members.

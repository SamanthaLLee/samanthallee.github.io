<a href="https://ruhackhers.org/">HackHERS</a> is the annual, women-centric hackathon at Rutgers University. We aim to create a space in which womxn can explore tech culture and be empowered to create with code.

For HackHERS 2020, I designed the main graphics of the event using Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator and marketed to thousands of people on-campus and online. As the current Executive Director, I am in the process of planning HackHERS 2021. Stay tuned for updates!

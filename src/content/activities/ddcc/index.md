<a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/ddcc/index">Rutgers Douglass-DIMACS Computing Corps</a> is Rutgers University's official Girls Who Code College Loops chapter. We dedicate ourselves to K-12 outreach encourage young girls to pursue computer science though technical workshops, panels, hackathons, and more. 

I was the Public Relations Officer from 2018-2019 and developed our website, curated our Instagram account, and produced marketing materials. Currently, I am the Recruitment Officer and serve as the face of the organization, seeking those interested in becoming members and coordinating our presence at involvement fairs.

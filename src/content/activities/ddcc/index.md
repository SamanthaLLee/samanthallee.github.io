<a href="hhttps://sites.rutgers.edu/girlswhocode/">Rutgers Girls Who Code</a> is Rutgers University's official Girls Who Code College Loops chapter. We dedicate ourselves to K-12 outreach encourage young girls to pursue computer science though technical workshops, panels, hackathons, and more. 

I was the Public Relations Officer from 2018-2019 and developed our website, curated our Instagram feed, and produced marketing materials. Currently, I am the Recruitment Officer and serve as the face of the organization, seeking those interested in becoming members and coordinating our presence at involvement fairs.

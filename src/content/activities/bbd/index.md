I was a <a href="https://www.bluebonnetdata.org/">Bluebonnet Data</a> Political Tech Fellow during the 2020 election cycle and trained on political technologies, including VAN, Outvote, ActionSprout, Deck, and BallotReady. I served as a volunteer technologist for Democrat down-ballot campaigns in Georgia and provided analyses to help campaigns more efficiently target voters and understand district demographics.

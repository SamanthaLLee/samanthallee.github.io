### About

<a href='https://leadlocally.org/'>Lead Locally</a> is a non-profit dedicated to electing community leaders who pledge to fight against fossil fuel projects. As a volunteer data analyst, I led a team of three to aggregate US data from multiple sources (Civis, Yale databases, Census, etc.) with Python, SQL, and Excel to identify locations vulnerable to fossil fuel projects on county, district, and city levels. We mapped this data with American voter statistics using JavaScript D3 to help campaigns target environmental issues and fight against climate change.

Given that the full load contained thousands of data points, it was necessary to make multiple calls to the service at once, and the use of Java's concurrency package improved efficiency by 90%.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I worked in Python to process information sprayed onto a Kinesis stream through various Lambda functions. In doing so, I created and updated DynamoDB entries containing brokerage account information. </p>\n<h3>Reflections</h3>\n<p>A huge thank you to Jordan Leach, Stephanie Manning, Abby Holdeman, and Shuaib Baig for their support and guidance throughout the summer!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Application Development Intern","start":"May 2020","end":"July 2020","tags":["internship","application development","vanguard"]},"excerpt":"Background The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is a federal law that sets minimum standards for most voluntarilyâ€¦","timeToRead":1}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/experience/vanguard/","templatePath":"./src/templates/experience-post.js"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3144751780","796719167"]}
